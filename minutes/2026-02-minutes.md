## Agenda

### Updates
- Noted Carpentries work on new AI-focused workshops.

### Open Science pilot support
- UCLA Open Science pilot call is generating interest; UCLA lacks capacity to run pilots themselves.
- Conversation covered possibilities to use reference docs to guide workshop leaders in gathering improvement feedback; suggested using LCGC as observers/helpers to capture issues during pilots and post-workshop meetings with instructors.

#### Action items
- Tim will coordinate between lesson authors and pilot instructors, reaching out to LCGC for help as observers and feedback coordination.

### Pathways
- Discussed creating lesson pathways (standalone → 1-day → multi-day) and resequencing; considered that some pathways have specific regional needs (privacy/GDPR, tool availability).
- Discussed metadata for lessons and minimum viable public-facing pathway page; bioschemas group referenced for training metadata.
- Some heavier lifting related to pathway creation might benefit from a grant. 
- Eka offered UX support and lean persona/prototype approach.

#### Action items
- Cody will follow up with Eka, Jennifer, and Nicky to draft an MVP pathway page/prototype and user review plan.

### How LCGC can support lesson maintainers (guest: Jose Niño Muriel)
- Discussed shared goals of GitHub workflow training and supporting lesson maintainers.
- Noted that Maintainer meetings are aimed at maintainers of established stable lessons so code sprints and lesson development support may be less relevant.
- Questions raised about LCGC expectations for maintainers and best outreach channels (Slack / TopicBox / handles in repos).

#### Action items
- LCGC and Jose will stay in touch re: schedule for GitHub workflow training and possible maintainers meet-and-greets.
